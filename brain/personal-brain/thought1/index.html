					<p><strong>Okay, first entry thingy that I'm writing</strong></p>
					<p>For those of you who don't get it, the "Personal Brain" section is supposed to like a blog.
					I just thought it would be funny if you were reading it directly from my brain.</p>
					
					<p>Don't expect anything that is even close to being reasonable while reading whatever I decide put here.</p>
					
					<p>Anyways, please let me know what you think of the site so far in the "Communal Brain" section!</p>
					
					<p>(It doesn't actually exist as I'm writing this but it'll be out by the time this
					post is released. But you don't know that, it's not like you can read my thoughts..)</p>
					
					<p>(ohwait)</p>
					
					<p>I kind of want a better graphic for all the thoughts but I couldn't think of anything good
					so I'm just going with the spinning [THOUGHT]. Works well with the rest of the site but I'm not
					a huge fan..</p>
