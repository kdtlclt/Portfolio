		Welcome to the Commission Kiosk!
		<br><br>
		It's pretty much just an info dump for all commission related things.
		<br><br>
		Click on the objects and I'll tell you more. Or go check out the Art Grove if you want to see more examples of my work. (Just ignore the non-cartoony ones. I'm not doing paint commissions)
		<br><br>
		I'll make the info (in the speech bubbles) look better in the future, but I'm just going with this for now because I want to have this page up asap.
