						<p>Alright, some quick context is in order..</p>
						
						<p>"Dan's Trouble" is a choose-your-own-adventure-comic that I made sometime between 2014 and 2016. 
						I don't remember the exact year I started working on this and I took like a year long break at some point.</p>
						
						<p>The comic is about a man named Dan Grave, who realizes that his friend's birthday is tomorrow and sets off to buy something
						for his party. Shenanigans ensue.</p>
						
						<p>After I finished it, I'm pretty sure I only showed this to like 1 friend. And I don't think he even read the whole thing.
						 I kind of just showed him some of the parts. But now I can use the power of HTML and CSS to finish what 10-12-year-old KDT started:</p>
						 
						 <p>Releasing this abomination</p><br>
						 
						 <p>Here's a list of things to expect:</p>
						 <p>horrible art, horrible writing, horrible grammar, horrible jokes, horrible everything</p><br>
