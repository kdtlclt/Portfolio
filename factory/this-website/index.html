						<p>Here are some sketches I made to plan the layout of site</p>
						<br>
						
						<p>Home Page Plan</p>
						<img src="homepage.png" width="80%">
						<p>I was originally going to put like the Matrix falling code effect on the side but the ads were funnier.</p>
						<p>"Joku kuva" just means "some picture" in finnish. It ended up being my sona and the thought bubble</p>
						<p>"Yappaton" ended up being the Brain, "Other Projects" became the Factory and there are still some things that I haven't finished yet...</p>
						<br>
						
						<p>About Page Plan</p>
						<img src="board.png" width="80%">
						<p>This one stayed pretty much exactly the way I planned it</p>
						<br>
						
						<p>Art Grove Plans</p>
						<img src="grove1.png" width="80%">
						<p>Orignally I was going to show a bunch of trees to choose from. The problem with that would have been the fact that it's hard
						to add new trees to it. Then I came up with the idea of choosing the tree from the signs on the side which not only looks better but
						 is also easier to expand.</p>
						<img src="grove2.png" width="80%">
						<p>But the basic idea of picking individual pieces from a tree stayed.</p>
						<br>
						
						<p>I'll add more plans here once whenever I make more...</p>
