We would like to thank you for choosing our Free Virus.

Unfortunately due to budget cuts we were not actually able to finish working on it
and one of our interns accidentally deleted all of the code.

We don't have any back ups of it so we're just simply asking you to delete everything on your pc and network.
This way, you will almost have the same experience.

We apologize for the inconveniance.
